# Competitive Programming
This repositroy keeps track of my informatics learning.

I put interesting and thought-provoking problems here.

Problems are from well-known OJs, include:
>POJ (http://poj.org/)

>SPOJ (http://www.spoj.com/)

>USACO (http://train.usaco.org/)

>UVaOJ (http://uva.onlinejudge.org/)

Besides OJ problems, I also put my programming class notes and my old Java templates.

Hope you enjoy problem solving!
